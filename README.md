Executed all instructions as requested. Two Observations are as follows: 

OBSERVATION 1: Charter Schools appear to deliver a higher overall passing rate at a lower cost per student, indicating a more efficient method of education versus the District Schools. 

OBSERVATION 2: District Schools appear to generally have a much higher discrepancy between pass rates for math and reading, compared to Charter Schools, which tend to have much smaller delta between reading and math pass rates. District Schools tend to perform much more poorly at math pass rates than reading pass rates.
